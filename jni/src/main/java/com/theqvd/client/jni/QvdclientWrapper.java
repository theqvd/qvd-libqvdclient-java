package com.theqvd.client.jni;

/**
 *
 * Represents a JNI wrapper to the qvdclient library.
 *
 * The wrapper is made up of two components:
 * 1) This class
 * 2) The qvdclientwrapper library which is jni wrapper to the qvdclient library
 *
 * The methods wrapped are the "public" methods for the qvdclient library
 * - qvd_init
 * - qvd_free
 * - qvd_list_of_vm
 * - qvd_connect_to_vm
 *
 * It uses an instance of Qvdclient to store the internal info like username, password, host and port.
 * This instance can be seen as a counterpart of the qvdclient struct defined in qvdclient.h, although
 * the data is not shared between the C library and the java object, it is only copied between both
 * structures.
